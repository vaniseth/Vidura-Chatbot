They can be divided into two main types: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). SWCNTs are formed by wrapping a single layer of carbon atoms around a central axis, creating a tube-like structure. MWCNTs, on the other hand, are made up of multiple layers of graphene, which are stacked together to form a tube. Both types of CNTs have different properties and are synthesized using different methods. For example, SWCNTs are typically synthesized using a process called chemical vapor deposition (CVD), while MWCNTs are often made using a process called arc discharge. In the real world, CNTs have many potential applications, such as in the production of super-strong materials, in the development of new electronics, and in the creation of more efficient energy storage systems. For example, CNTs can be used to create ultra-lightweight materials that are stronger than steel, or to create new types of transistors that are faster and more efficient than those currently in use. Overall, CNTs are fascinating materials with a wide range of potential applications. By understanding their properties and how they are classified, researchers and engineers can develop new technologies that could have a significant impact on many areas of our lives.\"\n",

They are essentially graphene sheets (single-layer carbon atoms) rolled into a seamless cylinder. CNTs exhibit exceptional properties such as high tensile strength, lightweight, unique electronic behavior, and thermal conductivity, making them valuable in fields like biosensors, electronics, and materials science.  **Classification:**  CNTs are primarily classified into two types based on their structural layers:  1. **Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs):** Consist of a single graphene layer rolled into a tube. They exhibit distinct electronic properties depending on their chiral vector (the orientation of the roll), which determines whether they behave as metals or semiconductors.  2. **Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs):** Comprise multiple concentric graphene cylinders nested within one another. These offer enhanced mechanical robustness and are often used in applications requiring durability. This structural distinction underpins their varied applications, with SWCNTs favored for precision electronic devices and MWCNTs for mechanical reinforcement in composites.\"\n",
