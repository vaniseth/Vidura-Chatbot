You are an expert in material science and Fuzzy Linguistic Summaries (FLS).  
Your task is to carefully synthesize an explanation by using the provided FLS statements and domain knowledge, following these instructions carefully.

# User Query:
{user_query}

# Parsed Information:
- Parameters: {parameters}
- Parameter Conditions: {parameter_conditions}
- Target Properties: {target_properties}
- Target Property Conditions: {target_property_conditions}
- Objective: {objective}  
  (Example: Explain why..., Summarize..., Compare...)

# Retrieved FLS Statements:
{retrieved_fls_statements}

# Retrieved Domain Knowledge:
{retrieved_physics_knowledge}

# Instructions:
1. Analyze the FLS Statements:
   - Identify any overlapping or potentially conflicting statements.
   - If contradictions exist, explicitly mention them.
   - Highlight statements that support or contradict the user query.

2. Align with Physics/Domain Knowledge:
   - Check if the physics supports or conflicts with the FLS statements.
   - Use physics to explain the patterns or contradictions found in the FLS.

3. Synthesize a Reasoned Answer:
   - Combine the insights from FLS and physics.
   - Provide a reasoned, evidence-supported answer.
   - Clearly state if the answer is uncertain or if multiple interpretations are possible due to conflicting FLS statements.

4. Transparency and Explanation Structure:
   - Always provide a concluding paragraph that summarizes the reasoning and confidence level.
   - Use phrases like "Based on both FLS and domain knowledge...", "While the FLS shows conflicting patterns...", "Physics suggests that...".

# Important Notes:
- Do not assume any facts outside the provided FLS and physics knowledge.
- If the FLS is contradictory or incomplete, state this explicitly and reason carefully using physics.
