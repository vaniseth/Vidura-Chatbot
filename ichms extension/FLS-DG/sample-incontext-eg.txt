User Query:
Explain why high σ_rate and low σ_angle lead to some pareto optimal points.

Parsed Query:
- Parameter 1: σ_rate = high
- Parameter 2: σ_angle = low
- Goal: Explain why some points are pareto optimal.

FLS Retrieved:
- Of the design points with very high σ_rate and low σ_angle, Some are pareto optimal points.
- Of the design points with high σ_rate and very high σ_angle, None are pareto optimal points.

Conflict Detection:
- No direct contradictions, but overlaps in 'σ_rate' with varying 'σ_angle'.
- FLS shows that lower σ_angle favors pareto optimality, while higher σ_angle does not.

Physics Retrieved:
- High σ_rate improves vertical growth.
- Low σ_angle improves alignment, which favors certain desirable properties.

Contradiction Resolution:
- The physics explains that the synergy of high σ_rate and low σ_angle improves both growth rate and alignment, leading to some pareto optimal conditions.
- FLS data confirms 'Some are pareto optimal', but this is in the context of specific σ_rate and σ_angle combinations.

Synthesized Explanation:
Based on physics, high σ_rate accelerates vertical growth while low σ_angle enhances alignment, together contributing to desirable outcomes. The FLS data supports this, showing that in these conditions, some design points achieve pareto optimality, although the presence of only 'Some' rather than 'Many' indicates that other factors may also play a role.
